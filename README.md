## Positions

### Position: Standing

Options:

- [Pull guard](#pull-guard)
- [Pull guard sweep](#pull-guard-sweep)
- Tug on to shoulder, back take and [mat return](#mat-return)

Tips:

- Stay low, knees bent
- Hips/shoulders more square until you need to keep one lapel away from your opponent
- Arms up in t-rex style, palms away

### Position: Full guard

Options:

- [Arm bar from guard](#arm-bar-from-guard)
- [Triangle from guard](#triangle-from-guard)
- [Omoplata from guard](#omoplata-from-guard)
- [Kimura from guard](#kimura-from-guard)

Defensive tips:

- Keep your ankles crossed until you need to open them
- Try to keep them from posturing back/up

Attacking tips:

- Keep your shoulders below the line of their belt/hips
- Hands on their stomach, no higher
- Never let your elbow cross the centre line
- Never put your hands on the floor

### Position: Open guard

Options:

- If you're the bottom and they're within your legs, close your legs and cross your ankles to get to [full guard](#position-full-guard)
- If you're the bottom and their outside of your leg range, keep your knees wide apart and your feet active to retain that position, if they pass your knees, you're screwed. Use your feet following them to rotate round to keep them inline with you.
- You can try an [idiot sweep](#idiot-sweep), but it's likely to get you crushed by senior belts if you try/manage it on them
- If you're standing/the top, you can try a [toreando pass](#toreando-pass)
- If you're standing/the top, you can try a [knee slice pass](#knee-slice-pass)

### Position: Half-guard top

Options:

- [Foot walkup and shin half-guard pass](#foot-walkup-and-shin-half-guard-pass)

### Position: Half-guard bottom

Options:

- [Gain knee shield half guard bottom](#gain-knee-shield-half-guard-bottom)

Tips:

- Keep their leg locked down in a figure four until you NEED to open it
- To control their leg one footed, turn your inside foot (of the two feet in bottom half-guard, one is inside of the pair, the other is outside) to the ground so your toes and knee are on the ground, but the gap between them (your shin) still traps their leg

### Position: Knee shield half guard bottom

Options:

- [Knee grab half guard pass](#knee-grab-half-guard-pass)
- [Ankle pick half guard pass](#ankle-pick-half-guard-pass)
- [Gi collar half guard pass](#gi-collar-half-guard-pass)
- [Back take half guard pass](#back-take-half-guard-pass)

### Position: Side control top

Options:

- [Side control far side americana](#side-control-far-side-americana)
- [Side control far side arm bar](#side-control-far-side-arm-bar)
- [Side control far side kimura](#side-control-far-side-kimura)
- [Side control breadcutter choke](#side-control-breadcutter-choke)
- [Side control baseball bat choke](#side-control-baseball-bat-choke)
- [Side control to knee on belly](#side-control-to-knee-on-belly)
- [Side control release to turtle top](#side-control-release-to-turtle-top)

Tips:

- Keep your weight pressed in to them, knees high on their body
- Top arm (nearest their head) under their neck and fingers in their far side armpit. If you're struggling to get this, some tips:
  1. Walk your fingers like a worm or a spider under their neck (NOT THEIR HEAD)
  2. Wave your hand side to side as it goes under, like a windscreen wiper (thanks Lindz)
  3. Use your head to push their head to the side your hand is going under, so it's moving less distance
- Pull them slightly up on to your knees to reduce their movement
- Use the under their neck shoulder pressing in to their neck to make them uncomfortable - the "Shoulder of Justice"
- To deal with an uncomfortable cross-face (forearm to the neck), you can do one of:
  1. Deal with the hip arm first (because that's stopping you putting your weight forwards), then just push forward to push that arm to their side
  2. Push on their tricep (so their arm slips past your neck and your neck is then on their tricep)

### Position: Side control botttom

Tips:

- Feel for their weight being too far to the side opposite their legs, bridging and flipping them over may be an option
- Frames are key for making space

Steps:

- Work your near side hand to the hip (elbow inside their knee)
- Work your far side hand across their throat (hand on the shoulder, straight wrist)
- Bridge to push them off, then keep your frame where is (don't try to push the frame out, but lift with the frame then drop and keep the frame)
- Shrip, knee insert and push/wiggle to recover [guard](#position-full-guard)

### Position: Back mount

Tips:

- Seat belt grip (one over the shoulders, one under the arm) is key for control
- When putting in your feet (hooks) go one at a time
- If you struggle to get your second hook in (they bring their knee to their elbow to close the gap), cross the ankle of the one hook behind their legs, and arch your back to extend them, then hook in with that second hook
- You want to keep your hips at the same height as theirs (don't be too high on their back or you can be shrugged off)
- When you roll to the side, keep them tight and try not to have your back flat on the floor
- NEVER cross your ankles

Options:

- [Rear naked choke](#rear-naked-choke)
- [Cross collar choke](#cross-collar-choke)
- [Bow and arrow choke](#bow-and-arrow-choke)

### Position: Full mount

Attacking tips:

- Don't get too low in the mount, it makes bridging buck you off more
- If they go elbows in tight, you can use a cross grip to grab each wrist (it's slightly stronger) and fake at one to attack the other (Gordon Ryan tip)
- If you're going to get a choke and step off to knee on belly or side control, make sure you have it ready to go!

Defensive tips:

- Keep your arms in tight
- Use your elbows on their legs/knees to lower them down
- You can [trap and roll](#trap-and-roll) to change to being in their [full guard](#position-full-guard)

### Position: Knee on belly

Tips:

- To make this more uncomfortable, grab hold of their collar and pull upwards towards the sky
- To make it more uncomfortable still, put your knee in their solar plexus rather than across their stomach
- Make sure your knee-on-belly foot is not on the floor (pressure on them)
- Take the opposite leg out, bent slightly and foot standing on the floor (so they can't grab it)

### Position: De la Riva

Tips:

- This is an open guard position where your foot is on the same-side hip of your standing oppoonent, and your opposite leg is wrapped around the back of their same-side knee/thigh
- You want to also control their posture ideally through a collar grip and an ankle grip on the side you're wrapping the leg
- If they try to pass De la Riva, then you go to [Reverse De La Riva](#position-reverse-de-la-riva)
- Try to keep your head off the floor and ideally on your side a bit, not flat-backed

Options:

- [Kick out sweep from De la Riva](#kick-out-sweep-from-de-la-riva)

### Position: Reverse De la Riva

Tips:

- This is an open guard position where your inside leg and outside leg wraps one of your opponent's one leg.
- When your opponent tries to pass to the hip-foot in [De la Riva](#position-de-la-riva) you wrap that hip-foot around the back of their other leg (x-side) and your previous wrapping foot move up to the front of their same side hip
- Try to keep your head off the floor and ideally on your side a bit, not flat-backed

## Transitions

Steps:

- On their untrapped leg, slight shrimp to be able to get the same side hand on their hip and ideally elbow slighly between their untrapped knee and your body
- Raise your other arm to the 12 O'clock position and forearm swipe down their face to make a neck frame (remember to have the frame's hand on their shoulder, forearm on the neck, fingers slightly cupping the outside of their shoulder)
- Reinforce the neck frame with the other hand (C grip or gable grip) and push away
- Shrimp and insert knee shield with the outside knee (not the one that's trapped obviously)

- Keeping them tightly to you, roll on to your back
- Establish your other foot as a hook and seatbelt control with your arms to gain [back control](#position-back-mount), not lying flat on your back though, more on your side (so you don't carry their weight)

- With your opposite hand grab the tricep (to stop them pulling it back out)

### Side control baseball bat choke

Steps:

- Although it starts from [side control](#position-side-control-top) you actually transition to [knee on belly](#position-knee-on-belly) first! So follow that [transition from side control to knee on belly](#side-control-to-knee-on-belly) then come back
