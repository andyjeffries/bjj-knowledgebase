* Raise your other arm to the 12 O'clock position and forearm swipe down their face to make a neck frame (remember to have the frame's hand on their shoulder, forearm on the neck, fingers slightly cupping the outside of their shoulder)
* Reinforce the neck frame with the other hand (C grip or gable grip) and push away
* Shrimp and insert knee shield with the outside knee (not the one that's trapped obviously)
* Keep one handed neck frame and with the other hand grab their wrist and pull to the floor (to keep them from fighting your neck frame)

* Put your currently inactive foot on the mid thigh of the cuff grip side
* Kick out the wrist grip side foot at the same time as pulling the cuff forward, and pulling to the cuff side with the collar side foot (like an inward crescent kick)
* As they fall forward, follow over and transition to [full mount](position-full-mount)
