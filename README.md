Tips:

- Keep their leg locked down in a figure four until you NEED to open it
- To control their leg one footed, turn your inside foot (of the two feet in bottom half-guard, one is inside of the pair, the other is outside) to the ground so your toes and knee are on the ground, but the gap between them (your shin) still traps their leg

## Gain knee shield half-guard bottom

Steps:

- On their untrapped leg, slight shrimp to be able to get the same side hand on their hip and ideally elbow slighly between their untrapped knee and your body
- Raise your other arm to the 12 O'clock position and forearm swipe down their face to make a neck frame (remember to have the frame's hand on their shoulder, forearm on the neck, fingers slightly cupping the outside of their shoulder)
- Reinforce the neck frame with the other hand (C grip or gable grip) and push away
- Shrimp and insert knee shield with the outside knee (not the one that's trapped obviously)
- Keep one handed neck frame and with the other hand grab their wrist and pull to the floor (to keep them from fighting your neck frame)
- Gets you to [Position: Knee shield half guard bottom](#position-knee-shield-half-guard-bottom)

## Knee grab half guard pass

Steps:

- From [Position: Knee shield half guard bottom](#position-knee-shield-half-guard-bottom)
- Either at the same time, or by pushing your shield knee out to straight, pass your outside arm under and around to gain an underhook.
- Grab the inside of their trouser material at their outside knee (the one they put on the floor alongside your stomach)
- Push them to the side of that knee, while pulling on their trouser to roll them over
- Pass round 180 degrees to [side control](#position-side-control-top)

## Ankle pick half guard pass

Steps:

- Either at the same time, or by pushing your shield knee out to straight, pass your outside arm under and around to gain an underhook.
- Quickly post your inside arm out to the mat away from them (to stop them grabbing and re-pulling you down)
- Reach under and grab the foot of their bent knee
- A subtle knee up the arse with your outside/top knee to push them to 12 O'clock
- Reach behind their leg with the underhook side (not over, but round the leg) and grab the foot.
- Same kind of pass as [knee grab half guard pass](#knee-grab-half-guard-pass), i.e. pull on their foot, push with your weight and then rotate round to [side control](#position-side-control-top)

## Gi collar half guard pass

Steps:

- From [Position: Knee shield half guard bottom](#position-knee-shield-half-guard-bottom)
- Either at the same time, or by pushing your shield knee out to straight, pass your outside arm under and around to gain an underhook.
- Undo their farthest gi lapel from their belt with your inside hand
- Pass the gi lapel under/between their legs
- A subtle knee up the arse with your outside/top knee to push them to 12 O'clock
- Pass the gi lapel to your outside hand (think of it as cutting between their nuts).
- Push them to the side of that knee, while pulling on their gi lapel to roll them over
- Pass round 180 degrees to [side control](#position-side-control-top)

## Back take half guard pass

Steps:

- From [Position: Knee shield half guard bottom](#position-knee-shield-half-guard-bottom)
- Either at the same time, or by pushing your shield knee out to straight, pass your outside arm under and around to gain an underhook.
- Quickly post your inside arm out to the mat away from them (to stop them grabbing and re-pulling you down)
- Shrug your shoulders to get rid of their "whizzer" (overhook on your underhook)
- Turn your inside knee to point to the floor (pulling their legs slightly wider apart at the same time) and come up on to that knee (effectively keeping your first hook in)
- Grab hold of the far side of their belt with your underhook hand and brace your forearm across their lower back
- Grab hold of the back of their collar and brace down their upper back
- Keeping them tightly to you, roll on to your back
- Establish your other foot as a hook and seatbelt control with your arms to gain [back control](#position-back-mount), not lying flat on your back though, more on your side (so you don't carry their weight)

## Pull guard

Steps:

- Get a same side cuff and an opposite same side collar grip
- Either sit the floor then put collar-grip-side foot on the hip, or put the foot on the hip and then sit down
- You can then pull them down in to your [open guard](#position-open-guard) and close the ankles to [closed guard](#position-full-guard) if you wish

## Pull guard sweep

Steps:

- Get a same side wrist and an opposite same side collar grip
- Either sit the floor then put collar-grip-side foot on the hip, or put the foot on the hip and then sit down
- Put your currently inactive foot on the mid thigh of the cuff grip side
- Kick out the wrist grip side foot at the same time as pulling the cuff forward, and pulling to the cuff side with the collar side foot (like an inward crescent kick)
- As they fall forward, follow over and transition to [full mount](position-full-mount)
